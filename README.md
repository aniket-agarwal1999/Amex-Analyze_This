# Amex-Analyze_This
Done as a part of the Amex Analyze this Hackathon.

The final best model uses Neural Network implemented using Keras library.

The preprocessing steps used:
1. Normalizing the values
2. Imputing the missing values by the median of the training data points
3. Applying PCA so as to summarize various input variables.
4. Removal of various not-so relevant variables

(The application of PCA and removal of variables were done after doing EDA on the data by plotting heatmaps ans also various different correlation graphs)

Start off by starting the environment using

`source hackit/bin/activate`
